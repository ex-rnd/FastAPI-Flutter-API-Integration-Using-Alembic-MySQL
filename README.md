# FastAPI-Flutter-API-Integration-Using-Alembic-MySQL
This project exposes a FastAPI-powered REST API backed by SQLAlchemy and Alembic, offering full CRUD on a MySQL “fruits” table with Pydantic schemas for validation. A Flutter front-end fetches that data, converts the 0/1 seedless flag into a Dart bool, and renders each fruit in a ListView as “Has Seeds” or “Seedless.”
